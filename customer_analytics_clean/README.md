# Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

# General

I prepared customer data by ensuring it was clean, well-structured, and ready for analysis
The goal was to standardize data types and appropriately manage categorical variables to facilitate further data exploration and modeling.

# Input

- [customer_train.csv](./customer_train.csv)

# Output

- [customer_clean.ipynb](./customer_clean.ipynb)
- [customer_train_clean.csv](./customer_train_clean.csv)

# Applied concepts

- Memory usage optimization
- List comprehension
- Lambda functions
- Boolean type conversion
- Handling ordered and unordered categorical data types

# Project brief

Provided by DataCamp:

> A common problem when creating models to generate business value from data is that the datasets can be so large that it can take days for the model to generate predictions. Ensuring that your dataset is stored as efficiently as possible is crucial for allowing these models to run on a more reasonable timescale without having to reduce the size of the dataset.
>
> You've been hired by a major online data science training provider called *Training Data Ltd.* to clean up one of their largest customer datasets. This dataset will eventually be used to predict whether their students are looking for a new job or not, information that they will then use to direct them to prospective recruiters.
>
> You've been given access to `customer_train.csv`, which is a subset of their entire customer dataset, so you can create a proof-of-concept of a much more efficient storage solution. The dataset contains anonymized student information, and whether they were looking for a new job or not during training
